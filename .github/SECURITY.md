# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will endeavour to support:

* the most recent minor release with bug fixes
* all versions if a security vulnerability is found provided:
  * 1) upgrading to a later version is non-trivial
  * 2) sufficient people are using that version to make support worthwhile

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find what you think might be a security vulnerability with CoveAPI, please do not create an issue on github. Instead please email github@yezz.me I'll reply to your email promptly and try to get a patch out ASAP.
